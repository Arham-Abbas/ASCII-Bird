# ASCII-Bird

Hey, this is one of my earliest projects, please don't look at the code if you would like to refrain from vomiting. I just realised a bunch of files are just songs that I don't have the license to and I'm too lazy to remove them so yeah.
During my school days I just thought of making this and for some reason I did, and it also has multi-threading in it, I have no idea why. I finally got around and put this in the wild.

This game is a steaming hot pile of garbage. But, hey, I was a kid.

So yeah! Go play! Please...
